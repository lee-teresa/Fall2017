/*Switch statements are good for handling multiple options
for input -- and responding with many possible cases.
Using a switch statement, write a program that emulates
a vending machine, in which the following numbers produce
the following chocolate bars:

1 -- Mars;
2 -- Snickers;
3 -- Milky Way;
4 -- Kit Kat;

For our purposes, it is enough to print out the chocolate bar's
name.
