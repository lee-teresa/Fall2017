/*Implement your own version of the echo command.
You’ll want to loop through the user’s arguments
and print them out one-by-one, adding a space
between them. You may want to try the echo command
on your Appliance first, to get a taste of how it works.
Tip: Remember to error check for correct number of
command line arguments!*/
